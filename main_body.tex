\section{Introduction}

\hspace{4mm} In our modern, computer-filled world, the security of information is paramount. Every web developer has been told to 'salt-and-hash' user passwords at least once in their life, and we all know the storied lives of Alice and Bob and their attempts to communicate securely.  Far too often, however, developers implementing large-scale systems either do not understand the origins of cryptography, leading to easily avoidable security vulnerabilities \cite{Software-Security}.

The relevance is especially apparent in light of recent attacks like that perpetrated against Sony this past November.
